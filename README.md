# SBA308
<!-- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. -->

This code grabs the "id": number, from the data above, checks to make sure that are no duplicates.
After that it will grab the assignment_id along with the submission/submitted_at date.
Compare those dates with the due_at date. 

Divide them into three different catergories.
-late
-do not count
-right time.

Once we got through the data and make sure we find the assignments that are vaild  
we calculate the average score for each "id": number.

In this assignment I used JavaScript.
